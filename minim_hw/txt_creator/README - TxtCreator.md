## Txt Creator
Warning: This code is poorly commented!  
## Creating different size .txt files
In the final line of the python script, TxtCreator() takes two arguments.  
For example: TxtCreator(64,128).main() will generate .txt files with line-length = 64 and number-of-lines = 128 (plus a newline character at the end).  
## How to use Txt Creator
Open a canvas window using the "Open draw window" button.  
Draw by clicking and dragging with the left mouse button.  
Erase parts of your drawing by clicking and dragging with the right mouse button.  
Save your drawing as a text file using the "Save and output as .txt" button.  
Start again by clicking the "Close draw window" button and repeating the above steps.  
## Tip for use
Any saved files will appear as "TxtCreatorOutput.txt" in the same folder as the Python script.  
Be sure to rename each file in your file explorer before saving new ones, or they will be overwritten.
